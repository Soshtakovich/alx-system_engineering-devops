Load Balancer (HAProxy):

Ensures high availability and scalability by distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers.
SSL termination at the load balancer allows for centralized management of SSL certificates and offloads decryption overhead from the web servers.
Potential issue: Terminating SSL at the load balancer may expose decrypted traffic within the internal network, necessitating additional security measures to safeguard internal communication channels.
Web Servers (Nginx):

Serve as the primary point of contact for client requests, handling HTTP/HTTPS traffic and efficiently serving static content.
Nginx's versatility and efficiency make it an ideal choice for handling web server responsibilities.
No specific issues mentioned, but ensuring proper configuration and security measures are essential to mitigate risks such as web server vulnerabilities.
Application Servers:

Host the application logic and handle dynamic content requests, executing server-side scripts and processing data.
Application servers may run various frameworks or technologies depending on the application's requirements (e.g., PHP, Python, Node.js).
No specific issues mentioned, but proper application hardening and secure coding practices are crucial to prevent vulnerabilities and exploits.
Database Servers (MySQL):

Store and manage website/application data, ensuring data integrity, availability, and scalability.
MySQL replication provides redundancy and fault tolerance by replicating data from the primary server to secondary servers.
Single point of failure: Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes introduces a risk of downtime and data loss in case of server failure. Implementing high availability solutions like database clustering or failover mechanisms can mitigate this risk.
Firewalls:

Control incoming and outgoing network traffic, protecting the infrastructure from unauthorized access and cyber threats.
Proper firewall rules and configurations are essential to enforce security policies and prevent malicious activities.
No specific issues mentioned, but misconfigurations or inadequate firewall rules can lead to security breaches and unauthorized access.
SSL Certificate:

Encrypts traffic between clients and servers, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.
SSL certificates are essential for securing sensitive information transmitted over the internet, such as login credentials, personal data, and financial transactions.
No specific issues mentioned, but ensuring SSL certificate validity, proper key management, and adherence to cryptographic best practices are critical to maintaining secure communications.
Monitoring Clients (Data Collectors):

Collect data on system performance, resource utilization, and security events to identify and address issues proactively.
Centralized monitoring platforms provide real-time visibility into the health and status of the infrastructure, enabling timely intervention and optimization.
Monitoring QPS (queries per second) provides insights into server load, performance bottlenecks, and potential scalability issues. Analyzing web server access logs can help track QPS and identify trends or anomalies.
No specific issues mentioned, but ensuring proper configuration and integration of monitoring tools with the infrastructure are necessary to ensure effective monitoring and alerting capabilities.
Overall, while the proposed infrastructure addresses the requirements for security, encryption, and monitoring, it's essential to consider potential vulnerabilities and single points of failure to design a robust and resilient system. Regular security audits, vulnerability assessments, and proactive maintenance are critical to maintaining the integrity and security of the infrastructure over time.
